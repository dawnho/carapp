Things I would improve on:

1. Parsing the Results better. I would figure out how the mileage corresponds to which pieces of maintenance instruction I should display.

2. I would dynamically generate some of the form fields, as opposed to statically laying them all out.

3. I would hide the search form after a search is performed, and add in a banner that shows which options had been selected.

4. Add in helper text for the inputs, that shows the requirements for those fields, ex. mileage should not exceed 300,000

5. Add in live form validation
